# MathNotes

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my TeX-based mathematics notes. Each class note set is a collection of practice problems, quantitative and qualitative explanation, and "margin notes". These were generated as a study aide for myself, and do not neccesarily represent best practices in mathematics or TeX formatting. 

These notes were generated using the Overleaf editor.

## Contents

The note set currently includes the following classes:

- Differential Geometry

The formula sheet set currently includes the following classes:

- Processor architecture and the MIPS Assembly Language

## Distribution

These notes are unrestricted for academic use. They may be edited, re-formatted, and re-produced without attribution.
