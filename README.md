# MathNotes

## Mission Statement

The goal of this repository is to provide free, high-quality reference material for individuals studying or self-studying mathematics at the college level.

## Introduction

There is an abundance of free mathematics reference material online. The goal of this repository is not to provide yet another free textbook, but rather to provide "class notes"-style reference material that is approachable and friendly. Instead of providing a full treatment on the material, the resources here are intended to provide a qualitative understanding of the topic and equip the reader with a foundation of terms, phrases, and equations that will lead to further independent research. The goal of this repository is to provide high-quality and accurate, friendly and approachable material suited to inspire further research for the struggling student or the mathematical layperson.

Each document will include definitions, equations, quantitative and qualitative explanations, and worked example problems. 

## Contents

The note set currently includes the following classes:

- Differential Geometry

The formula sheet set currently includes the following classes:

## Technical Information

These documents were prepared using the Overleaf TeX editor.

## Distribution

These resources may be freely distributed and revised. Revisions, edits, additions, and corrections are invited and encouraged!
